      <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
        Hi! My name is Galih Prastian and I am a hard-working back-end developer with over 4 years of demonstrated working experience.
        <br /><br />
        I am skilled mainly in back-end development (Go, PHP, Node.js), but also fluent in front-end development as well. With a vision of improving people&apos;s lives through technology, I am able to thrive in working both individually and in a team, always eager to learn new technologies, and strive to develop great & valuable experiences for everyone.
